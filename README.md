# iRacing-Launcher
My custom PS script to launch iRacing and the tools I use.

# Notes
I threw this together very quickly as I got fed up of launching all the apps manually.  I do plan to actually improve on it to make it less basic.  Any comments and suggestions welcome.

# Planned
* Ensure all apps (excluding iRacing) start minimised
* Move controls and outputs to a GUI
